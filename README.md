Horiseon has asked of me to clean up their code and make the website more user friendly by adding descriptions to the images on the website. 

To do this I removed many of the divs and replaced them with more descriptive elements (see notes in html code).

I also went through the images and added <alt> attributes, which will describe the images to those who need them.
